//To wrap up this first week we're going to combine everything into our first Particle System
//We need 2 classes: ParticleSystem and Particle
//(You can use the same file or add a separete one for the Particle-class)

//Your particle has a few properties:
//location, velocity, acceleration, mass & lifespan

//Your particle system implements gravity

//Optional: try to make this system visually more interesting
//Look up other examples or check-out example 4.8: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/
